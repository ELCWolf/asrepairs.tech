                <h2>How to Bypass the Automatic Repair Loop on Windows</h2>
           
            <p>The "Automatic Repair" loop is a common issue for Windows users. It's frustrating when your PC continuously attempts to
            diagnose itself and enter an endless repair cycle, preventing you from accessing your system. Whether it's due to
            corrupted system files, faulty hardware, or a recent update gone wrong, this guide will show you how to bypass the
            "Automatic Repair" loop and get your system back up and running.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="1">
                <h2>What is the Automatic Repair Loop?</h2>
When Windows detects a startup issue, it automatically tries to diagnose and repair the problem. In some cases, instead
of resolving the issue, Windows gets stuck in an endless loop of trying to repair itself, but ultimately failing,
leaving users with no way to boot into the system normally.
            </section>
            <section id="2">
                <h2>Causes of the Automatic Repair Loop</h2>
                <p>There are several reasons why this loop might occur:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corrupted system files from an improper shutdown, software issues, or virus infection.</li>
                    <li>Hardware issues like a failing hard drive or SSD.</li>
                    <li>Failed Windows updates or bad drivers.</li>
                    <li>Incorrect boot configurations in the system's boot files.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="3">
                <h2>Methods to Bypass the Automatic Repair Loop</h2>
                <p>Here are several ways to bypass the loop and get back into your system. If one method doesn’t work, try the next until
                the issue is resolved.</p>
                <h2>Method 1: Disable Automatic Repair on Startup</h2>
                <p>Enter the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)
                
                Power on your computer and, as soon as Windows tries to boot, hold the power button to force a shutdown.
                Repeat this process two more times, and on the third restart, Windows should automatically boot into WinRE.
                Access the Command Prompt
                
                In the WinRE, click on Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Command Prompt.
                Disable Automatic Repair
                
                Once the Command Prompt opens, type the following command and press Enter:
                bash
                Copy code
                bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no
                This will disable the automatic repair feature, so Windows won’t attempt to repair itself at startup.
                
                Restart Your PC
                
                Now, restart your PC and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="4">
                <h2>Method 2: Run System File Checker (SFC) and CHKDSK</h2>
                <p>
                    Corrupted system files can often cause the repair loop. Running system scans can help restore damaged files.
                    
                    Access the Command Prompt via WinRE as explained in Method 1.
                    
                    Run the System File Checker (SFC)
                    
                    In the Command Prompt, type:
                    <pre><code>
                            sfc /scannow        
                    </code></pre>
                    
                    This will scan your system for any corrupted files and attempt to repair them.
                    
                    Run Check Disk (CHKDSK)
                    
                    After SFC completes, run CHKDSK to fix any errors on your disk:
                    <code><pre>
                        chkdsk /r c:
                    </pre></code>
                    
                    This will scan for bad sectors and recover any readable data.
                    
                    Restart your PC after both commands have completed to see if the issue is resolved.

                <h2>Method 3: Restore the Master Boot Record (MBR)</h2>
                <p>If the Master Boot Record is corrupted, it can prevent Windows from booting properly.
                
                Enter Command Prompt in the WinRE as shown in Method 1.
                
                Restore the MBR
                
                In the Command Prompt, type each of the following commands and press Enter after each one:</p>
                <pre><code>
                    bootrec /fixmbr
                    bootrec /fixboot
                    bootrec /scanos
                    bootrec /rebuildbcd
                </code></pre>
                <p>Restart your PC and check if the issue is resolved.</p>

            <section id="5">
                <h2>Method 4: Disable Early Launch Anti-Malware Protection</h2>
                <p>Some drivers or third-party software might be interfering with the boot process, causing Windows to fail repeatedly.
                
                Enter the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) as mentioned above.
                
                Go to Startup Settings
                
                In WinRE, click Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Settings.
                Disable Early Launch Anti-Malware Protection
                
                Click Restart, then press the 8 key on your keyboard to select Disable Early Launch Anti-Malware Protection.
                Restart your PC and check if it boots properly.</p>

<h2>Method 5: Perform a System Restore</h2>
<p>
If your system has a restore point, this method allows you to roll back to a previous state where everything was working
fine.

Enter WinRE and select Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > System Restore.

Choose a Restore Point

Follow the on-screen instructions and select a restore point from before the issue started.
Restore Your PC

Allow Windows to restore your system. Once complete, restart your computer.

<h2>Method 6: Reset or Reinstall Windows</h2>
<p>
If all else fails, you may need to reset or reinstall Windows. This method should be used as a last resort, as it may
result in data loss.

Enter WinRE and select Troubleshoot > Reset this PC.

Choose an Option

You can choose either Keep my files (which keeps your personal files but removes apps and settings) or Remove everything
(which performs a full reset).
Follow the Instructions

Follow the on-screen prompts to reset your PC. Once completed, Windows should reinstall and the repair loop should be
bypassed.

                <h2>Prevention Tips
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To avoid future instances of the automatic repair loop, consider these preventive measures:
                    
                    Keep your system up to date: Regularly update Windows and your device drivers.
                    Use proper shutdown procedures: Avoid force-shutting down your PC frequently.
                    Perform regular disk checks: Use built-in Windows tools like sfc /scannow and chkdsk regularly.
                    Back up your data: Always keep backups of important files in case you need to perform a reset.
                    Conclusion
                    The automatic repair loop is an annoying but often fixable issue. By following the methods above, you can bypass the
                    repair loop and get your system working again. If none of these methods work, it might indicate a deeper hardware issue,
                    and you should consider seeking professional help or replacing malfunctioning hardware.
